## Step 4: Play time! ü§æ üèÑ


Now, with Copilot's workspace prepared, let's work on some more complex issues to make the Extra curricular Activities website even more amazing! ‚ú®üöÄ

Until now, we've been teaming up with Copilot by assigning issues one at a time. üìùü§ù

But what if you could skip the extra steps and jump straight into task mode? What if Copilot could juggle several jobs at once, keeping you in the loop as they progress? ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Let's see how that's done! üëÄ

### üìñ Theory: Delegate from anywhere!

The agents panel is your mission control center for agentic workflows on GitHub.

It‚Äôs a lightweight overlay that allows you to hand new tasks to Copilot and track existing tasks without navigating away from your current work. Just click the new Agents button in the navigation bar to get started.

From the agents panel, you can:

- üõ†Ô∏è Assign background tasks without switching pages.
- üëÄ Monitor running tasks with real-time status.
- üîó Jump into pull requests when you‚Äôre ready to review.

With the Agents panel, you can quickly assign multiple issues, track their progress, and review results‚Äîall in one place.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Try the Copilot Agents panel

1. Open the **Copilot Agents** panel from the GitHub sidebar.
1. Locate the issues you want to assign (for example, `Difficulty Tracks` and `Outdated Docs`).
1. Assign both issues to Copilot using the panel controls.
1. Monitor the status and progress of each assigned issue directly in the panel.
1. When the pull requests are ready, review and merge them as needed.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Try implementing 2 issues simultaneously ü§Ø

1. In the top navigation, select the **Issues** tab.

1. Find the the following 2 issues and open each in a new tab.

   - `Difficulty Tracks`

   - `Outdated Docs`

1. With both tabs open, assign both to Copilot simultaneously.

1. In both, navigate to the created pull request, scroll down, and click the **View Session** button to watch Copilot's live progress. Alternately, go take a quick break (again!). ‚òïÔ∏è

1. When they are done, change both from draft mode and then merge them. üòç

1. Nice work! With at least 1 pull request merged, Mona should be checking your work and preparing your final review.

> Working on multiple issues in parallel is an art-form. üé®
> Make sure you keep them independent to avoid merge conflicts! üò±
